      "Little quacks.\n",
      "In fact, the quacks that there were, I think people didn't even notice.\n",

      "He told me, did you do it on purpose, the fact of forgetting the credits?\n",
      "Because it coincided with the side...\n",
      "It started, you see.\n",

      "No, no.\n",

      "because, yes, there's staging.\n",
      "The light...\n",
      "Well, really, everyone really worked,\n",

      "and so they were in the lodges, and they were laughing,\n",
      "they were talking.\n",
      "But, yes, yes, an hour's delay on the conductor,\n",
      "on the side of...\n",
      "On the side of Flo Flo.\n",
      "But, yes, because the last night,\n",
      "it lasted almost three hours, in fact, the show.\n",
      "Fuck.\n",
      "In fact, there was so much happening,\n",
      "so much...\n",
      "We still tried to keep the will.\n",
      "It's the other thing, too,\n",
      "I saw some comments on...\n",
      "Because, when we record,\n",
      "we only released one live,\n",
      "the one with Benjamin and Morgan.\n",
      "It's that I cut a lot of stuff,\n",
      "because there are a lot of stuff,\n",

      "there are...\n",
      "Yes, yes, yes.\n",
      "There are happenings, that's it.\n",
      "But we're going to put the Floodcast stories\n",
